Instructions:
           I choose the No.1 project and I choose selenium web driver to finish this automation test.
	1. git clone the project from github url:        https://github.com/XiaoranAn/walmart.git
	2. open a java Eclipse IDE and import the project
	3. go to folder src/main/java, package com.walmart.automateTest,
	4. right click on chromeTest.java and choose Run_As ==> JUnit_Test
	5. this will start the automation test process
	6. the test program will automatically opens a chrome browser and start an end-to-end user e-commerce transaction flow using Selenium web driver for www.walmart.com.
	
Clarification:
	the test program first validates user login:
		assertEquals("Welcome to your Walmart account!",welcomeHeader.getText());
		above line of code that checks if the user has logged in successfully or not.
	
	test program then:
	     performs searches on keywords: tv, socks, dvd, toys, and iPhone	     adds an item to cart and validate item added is present in the cart and is the only item in the cart.
	     
          assertEquals("1 item", quantityOneTV.getText());         ===> this line of code makes sure only 1 item is present in the shopping cart
	      
	     assertEquals(oneItemTitle, oneItemTitle1.getText());     ===> this line of code checks item added is present in the cart and has the same title as the one we selected before added into the shopping cart.
		
	when all the tests are done, the program will close the chrome browser.
